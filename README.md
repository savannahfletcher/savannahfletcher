- **EmpowerWiNG Studio Hackathon Project**: TypeScript w/ React | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/savannahfletcher/EmpowerWingStudio), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/empowerwing-studio)
  - Constructed the front-end of a web-based platform designed to give exposure to woman, non-binary, and gender non-conforming small artists, business-owners, and creators. Acted team leader in driving the project vision and direction by structuring efficient communication and collaboration amongst the team, ultimately launching a unified website within given time constraints.
- **ChompSci**: TypeScript w/ React | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/savannahfletcher/ChompSci)
  - A web-based application designed to bring the UF Computer Science community together by promoting and organizing events and opportunities, as well as encouraging CS students to connect more with one another. As a front-end developer for this team, I contributed to the login form, opportunities page (message posting), and "About Us" page.
- **PressPlay**: C++ w/ SFML | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/savannahfletcher/PressPlay)
  - This program uses a player's Steam ID (a popular video game storefront) to determine their most played video game and recommend the player three games based on their favorite. Using two different data structures to store and call the video game data, this project also serves as an experiment to compare time complexity (in the form of runtime in ms). For this team project, I handled all frontend development.
